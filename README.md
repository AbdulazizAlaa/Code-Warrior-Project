Code-Warrior-Project
====================

This a small project some friends and i did for the Koding Website Hackathon we were trying to build a way for people to learn to code.
i know this already exist but we are trying to experiment with the Html 5 Canvas and we are trying to build an exceptional one as well.
a part of this project was done already in the hackathon in a private repo and it has some bugs. So first thing i am moving it here then fix these bugs and continue working on this after the finals.
Feel free to contribute :D
